    <p>
        <em>
        AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. These machines typically include computer systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language understanding.

    <p>
        <em>
       
            CO2 is carbon dioxide, a gas essential for life on Earth. It's produced naturally and by human activities. While necessary for plants and the environment, too much CO2 contributes to global warming and climate change.
